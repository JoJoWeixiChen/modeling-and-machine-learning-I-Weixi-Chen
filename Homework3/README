## Homework3

Using the RMarkdown/knitr/github mechanism, implement the following tasks:
1. Use the prostate cancer data.
2. Use the cor function to reproduce the correlations listed in HTF Table 3.1, page 50.
3. Treat lcavol as the outcome, and use all other variables in the data set as predictors.
4. With the training subset of the prostate data, train a least-squares regression model with all predictors using the lm function.
5. Use the testing subset to compute the test error (average squared-error loss) using the fitted least-squares regression model.
6. Train a ridge regression model using the glmnet function, and tune the value of lambda (i.e., use guess and check to find the value of lambda that approximately minimizes the test error).
7. Create a figure that shows the training and test error associated with ridge regression as a function of lambda
8. Create a path diagram of the ridge regression analysis, similar to HTF Figure 3.8
